### Project Outline

This project implements an 8-bit binary counter using an **ATmega328P microcontroller**, designed and simulated in **Proteus** before being prototyped on a **breadboard**. The counter supports both **incrementing** and **decrementing** modes, controlled by two push buttons.

An additional button triggers a **reset sequence**, which flashes all LEDs in a pattern before clearing the counter. The current count is displayed in **binary** using 8 onboard LEDs connected to the microcontrollerâ€™s output pins.

This design emphasizes simplicity, user interaction, and visual clarity, making it ideal for learning and demonstrating embedded system fundamentals such as GPIO, debouncing, and binary counting logic.

### Future Upgrades

- LCD screen that displays:
  - Count in **binary and decimal**
  - **Counting direction**
  - **Reset status**
